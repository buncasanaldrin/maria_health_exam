# GUIDELINE
1. cd Data\ Driven/data_driven/

2. python manage.py runserver

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a. Users should be able:
    1. View all plans available with the details above
        - 'plans/'

    2. Instantiate new carts
        - 'order_products/'

    3. Add items to the carts
        - 'order_products/'

    4. Change the count of an item in a cart
        - 'order_products/<int:pk>/'

    5. Remove an item from the cart
        - 'order_products/<int:pk>/'

    6. See the items in a cart
        - 'carts/<int:pk>/'

    7. Pay for the cart. Just create an endpoint that when invoked, automatically marks the cart as paid
        - 'carts/<int:pk>/'

b. You can use any protocol/paradigm for your API, and you can third party libraries
when creating the API
    1. Describe your API and the decisions you took when designing it
        - I used django generics.APIView, because it's more easy to use and to create REST endpoints.
          it also provides some attributes that will help you saves a lot of time.
