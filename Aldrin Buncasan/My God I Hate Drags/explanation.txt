How is Maria Health’s method of loading pages better than the traditional method?

Answer:
It's faster because the logic is within the web browser rather than the server.
Only the data is sent back and forth rather than the whole HTML.


How is it worse?

Answer:
Search engines cannot index an AJAX application.
Client must enable javascript.


When should each be used over the other?

Answer:
Traditional method
 - If application needs to run without the Javascript support.
 - If application's client side requirements are simple and needs to perform well in search engines


Maria Health’s method
 - If application's client side has complex design.
 - It's responsive and can easily be converted to mobile.
